### Production-Grade Deployment of MEMOS on AWS ECS Fargate ###

## Overview
This project delivers a production-grade, end-to-end deployment of a privacy-focused memo application on Amazon Web Services using Amazon ECS Fargate. It utilises Docker for containerisation, Terraform for infrastructure as code, and GitHub Actions to automate both infrastructure provisioning and application delivery.
The solution is designed to be secure, scalable, and production-ready, incorporating HTTPS encryption, persistent storage, and a fully automated CI/CD pipeline to ensure consistent and repeatable deployments.
